# MatchingFields
MatchingFields is a package for Macaulay2. A matching field is a combinatorial object that parametrises certain toric degenerations of Grassmannians and partial flag varieties of type An. The main features of this package allow the user to: 
- construct a matching field,
- consruct a matching field polytope,
- check whether a matching field is coherent,
- construct a matching field ideal,
- check whether a matching field gives rise to a toric degeneration,
- compute the matroidal regular subdivision of the hypersimplex associated to a matching field for the Grassmannian (1).

The package is currently in development but most of the core functionality is implemented. However, many of the main functions are not documented.

## Notes:
1. A coherent matching field is natrually associated to a cone of the tropicalisation (of the open subset of the Grassmannian where the Pleucker coordinates are non-vanishing) and, therefore, is a subset of the corresponding Dressian, which (as a set) is the collection of weights that induce a regular matroidal subdivision of the hypersimplex (in the case of the Grassmannian).
